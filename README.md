# 📚 JS Algorithm Practice

Welcome to my JavaScript Algorithm Practice repository! 🚀  
This repository is a collection of algorithm challenges I worked on to improve my JavaScript and problem-solving skills.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

The challenges are organized by topics:

- **arrays/** → Array-related challenges
- **conditions/** → Conditional statement challenges (if, else-if)
- **date/** → Date object related challenges
- **functions/** → Function structure challenges
- **loops->fizzBuzz/** → Loop-based FizzBuzz challenge
- **loops->factorial/** → Loop-based Factorial challenge
- **math/** → Math-related algorithm challenges
- **objects/** → Object manipulation challenges
- **projects/** → Native JS mini projects
- **strings->endOfLine/** → String manipulation challenge (End of Line)
- **strings->spellingProgram/** → String manipulation challenge (Spelling Program)

Each folder contains:
- JavaScript solution file (.js or .html)
- A short README.md explaining the challenge (if available)
