# JavaScript Objects Challenge

This project contains a set of challenges designed to help you learn how to work with JavaScript objects. It covers object creation, modification, deletion, destructuring, and iteration.

## Contents

This challenge includes the following topics:

1. **Creating an Object**: Defining an object and accessing its properties.
2. **Adding New Properties to an Object**: Adding the `city` property.
3. **Updating Object Properties**: Modifying the `age` property.
4. **Deleting Object Properties**: Removing the `country` property.
5. **Using Destructuring**: Extracting `name` and `country` properties.
6. **Using Object.keys() and Object.values()**: Listing object keys and values.
7. **Using the Spread Operator**: Merging two objects.
8. **Destructuring Nested Objects**: Extracting `city` from the `address` object.
9. **Iterating Over an Object with for...in Loop**.
10. **Conditional Object Property Check**: Checking if a property exists in an object.

## How to Use

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```
3. **Open `object.html` in a web browser.**

## Example Output
