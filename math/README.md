# Prime Number Challenge

This project is an HTML and JavaScript application that solves a prime number challenge by verifying if a number is prime, finding the nearest prime number, and summing the closest prime numbers.

## Features
- **Prime Number Validation**: The `isAsal(num)` function checks if a given number is prime.
- **Find Nearest Prime**: The `nearestAsal(num)` function finds the closest prime number to the given input.
- **Sum of Nearest Primes**: The `additionAsal(num)` function finds the closest prime numbers below and above the input number and sums them.
- Displays the result in the browser console.

## Usage
1. Clone the project to your computer:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Enver-Onur-Cogalan/Challenge-Find_Prime_Numbers.git
   ```
2. Open `findPrimeNumbers.html` in a web browser.
3. Modify the function call `additionAsal(100);` with your desired number inside the `<script>` tag.
4. Open the browser console (F12 > Console) to see the output.

## Example
If you enter `100`, the output will be:
```
97 + 101 198
```
and it will be displayed in the browser console.
